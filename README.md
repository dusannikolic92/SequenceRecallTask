# SequenceRecallTask
This is a Sequence Recall Task I used in my dissertation. The entire code is written in jspsych 6.3. and the experiment was hosted on Cognition.run platform.
In the sequence recall task, the listener first learns that they need to press a keyboard key (for example [A]) when they hear a specific category (word, tone, phone, etc.). The listener then presses another keyboard key (for example [L]) when they hear a specific category (word, tone, phone, etc.) These two categories present contrasts and the listener is required to press the keys in order these are played. The sequences of items increase. For example, the listener starts with two items, and then they move on to four, and finally to six items. The greater the number the greater the memory load. Because of this recall of the sequences, the task is called the Sequence Recall Task.
